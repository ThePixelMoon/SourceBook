## Workshop
> Check steam.md for brief information

The [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/) workshop is a built-in addon manager for games. To download there, go to the community hub in [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/), and click Workshop. In there, click on any addon/mod you want to install, and then click on the button **Subscribe**. Make sure to restart your game after that.

The Workshop only works if you are subscribing to a game you own, so you can't get a game for free in there. If you can, it's either you report it, or silently subscribe to it.

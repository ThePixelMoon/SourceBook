**Linux** is an operating system made by **Linus Torvalds**. A lot of stuff was based off it, such as:
- Distro(s), such as *Debian*, *Arch* and etc.
- Apps (such as the *GCC compiler*)

The correct way of saying **Linux** is ***GNU/Linux***. It's *open source*, and it was firstly released on September 17, 1991.

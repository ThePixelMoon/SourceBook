**Half-Life 2**â„¢ is a game made by **Valve**, released on 
November 16, 2004. It used the **Source** game engine, made by the same company, which had mind-blowing physics.

The beta-version of it was leaked, around in 2003, which had the entire **source code** base, including the *physics engine*.<sup>[[1]](https://github.com/Clepoy3/LeakNet)</sup>

Later, it got leaked in **2018**, which had the *modern* **Source Engine** code, alongside with *CS:GO*, and *Team Fortress 2*.<sup>(unsure, because only the source engine code got leaked, but it had three of those in.)</sup>

The 20'th anniversary update added the [Workshop](../workshop.md) support, alongside with <abbr title="Quality Of Life">QOL</abbr> changes and bug fixes.

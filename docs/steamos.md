> This page lacks of information, if you can, add more.

**SteamOS** is a Linux distro, mainly used in **Steam Deck**s. It was built as a client for video game streaming.

**SteamOS** originally launched (1.0, 2.0) in 2013, was based on the Debian distribution of Linux with GNOME desktop environment.

In February 2022, **Valve** launched the Steam Deck, a handheld gaming device that runs a completely remade version of **SteamOS** (3.0).

The new version is based on **Arch Linux** and comes with the **KDE Plasma** desktop environment pre-installed. It also includes **Valve**'s Proton compatibility layer, which allows many **Windows** games to run seamlessly on **SteamOS**.

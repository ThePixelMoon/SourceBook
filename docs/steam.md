## Steam
[Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/) is a digital distribution platform for video games, originally launched in 2003. It supports automatic game updates, cloud saving, and integrates community functions such as direct messaging, the **Workshop** and much much more.

In 2008, **Steamworks** was released, an API for developers to integrate [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/) features into their game.

[Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/) was later expanded from just Windows, to Linux, Mac-OS, and even mobile platforms in the early 2010s.
